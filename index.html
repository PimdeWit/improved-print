        <h1>A snippet from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></h1>
        <p>The term "hyperlink" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson" title="Ted Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> at the start of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a>. Nelson had been inspired by "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think" title="As We May Think">As We May Think</a>", a popular 1945 essay by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex" title="Memex">Memex</a>) in which one could link any two pages of information into a "trail" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.</p>

        <p>In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk" title="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart" title="Douglas Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Rulifson" title="Jeff Rulifson">Jeff Rulifson</a> as chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" title="Programmer">programmer</a>) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)" title="NLS (computer system)">NLS</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman" title="Ben Shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a> working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/">HyperTIES system</a> in 1983. HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. In 1988, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman" title="Ben Shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a> and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish "Hypertext Hands-On!", the world's first electronic book.</p>

        <p>The <b>Pallas's leaf warbler</b> or <b>Pallas's warbler</b> (<i>Phylloscopus proregulus</i>) is a bird that breeds in mountain forests from southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> east to northern Mongolia and northeastern China. It is named for German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology" title="Zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Simon_Pallas" title="Peter Simon Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a>, who first formally described it. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_warbler" title="Leaf warbler">leaf warbler</a> is strongly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration" title="Bird migration">migratory</a>, wintering mainly in southern China and adjacent areas of southeast Asia, although in recent decades increasing numbers have been found in Europe in autumn.</p>

        <p>Pallas's leaf warbler is one of the smallest Eurasian warblers, with a relatively large head and short tail. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, a lemon-yellow rump, and yellow double wingbars, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercilium" title="Supercilium">supercilia</a> and central crown stripe. It is similar in appearance to several other Asian warblers, including some that were formerly considered to be its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>, although its distinctive vocalisations aid identification.</p>

        <p>The female builds a cup nest in a tree or bush, and incubates the four to six eggs, which hatch after 12–13 days. The chicks are fed mainly by the female and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fledge" title="Fledge">fledge</a> when they are 12–14 days old; both parents then bring food for about a week. Pallas's leaf warbler is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivorous</a>, feeding on the adults, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa" title="Pupa">pupa</a> of small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>. Birds forage in bushes and trees, picking items from leaves or catching prey in short flights or while hovering. The Pallas's leaf warbler has a large range, and its numbers are believed to be stable. It therefore is evaluated as of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-concern_species" title="Least-concern species">least concern</a>" by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).</p>
