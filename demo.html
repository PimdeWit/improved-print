      <h1>A snippet from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></h1>
      <p>The term "hyperlink" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson" title="Ted Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> at the start of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a>. Nelson had been inspired by "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think" title="As We May Think">As We May Think</a>", a popular 1945 essay by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex" title="Memex">Memex</a>) in which one could link any two pages of information into a "trail" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.</p>
      
      <p>In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk" title="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart" title="Douglas Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Rulifson" title="Jeff Rulifson">Jeff Rulifson</a> as chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" title="Programmer">programmer</a>) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)" title="NLS (computer system)">NLS</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman" title="Ben Shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a> working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/">HyperTIES system</a> in 1983. HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. In 1988, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman" title="Ben Shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a> and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish "Hypertext Hands-On!", the world's first electronic book.</p>
